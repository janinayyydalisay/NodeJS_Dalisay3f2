Explanation of Whole Code:

The provided Node. This is a basic application of js web application and here, the Express framework is used to build the server application in JavaScript. The essay explores the application's key components: In the case of the new vocabulary, it meant that a package was something that was presented in the form of a package. json`, `package-lock. json`, and `app. The combination of HTML and CSS is clearly illustrated on how they complement each other in creating a compact web environment identified by js.

//Dependency Management// is done by a package. json` and `package-lock. json), which is just contains the basic information about the project such as the name, current version and dependencies that should be used in the project (express, ejs and body parser), while the second file is used to avoid using the generalized package by using lock that only allow the specified version of package to be used in the project.

The //Core Functionality// of the application depends from the `app. Such, application.js manages dependencies, loads middleware and defines routes then starts running an Express server: ```javascript js ``, This file deals with important actions include but not limited to configuring the view engine (EJS), serving static assets and mapping a URL request to a particular part of the application through modules or routers. also has a 404 handler for when the clients enter an undefined route and prepares the server to run on a given port to finally be ready for deployment.

The //Dependencies// include Express, EJS, and Body-Parser; they are the foundation of any MEAN application as they provide the capability of handling Routing and Rendering of content in html format and handling potential requests for bodies in future development.
